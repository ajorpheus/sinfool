 [v.1] Tested with an iP6+ 8.4.  (9-3-15)
 .
 FYI:  If you're using two different wallpapers for your LS & HS and not already using something like HiddenSettings to change/remove the black unlock animation... Then I recommend using this patch along with the patch titled "No 'Fade To Black' Animation".
 .
 ⚠️WARNING:  One entry conflicts with Tage's "System Close Animation" option so therefore disable that option in Tage OR... delete/change the unit specified below to "pass-through".
