Package: com.sinfool.tabbarsimplylargelabelscustomiable
Name: Tab Bar - Simply Large Labels (Customizable)
Author: Sinfool
Description: Provides options to change the font size and hide tab bar elements.  By default, I have everything hidden except for the labels of which I've made larger.  You can choose what you want shown or hidden by using the variables I suggested or by just deleting the units of items you want shown.
