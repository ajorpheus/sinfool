Package: com.sinfool.sleekswitcher
Name: SleekSwitcher  ₄₋₁₆₋₁₅
Author: Sinfool
Description: Gives your switcher a transparent sleek look while also allowing the ability to multitask/interact with the switcher when an open app is in the foreground.  By default,  I centered the previews to HS & removed the Contacts Section/Icon Labels however these items can be adjusted/re-enabled as you please.  To kill apps... access the switcher from the home screen & slide up where said app card preview should be.  Made after reading a recent post on reddit.
