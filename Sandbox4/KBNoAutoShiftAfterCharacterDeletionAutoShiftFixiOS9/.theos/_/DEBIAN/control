Name: KB - No Auto Shift After Character Deletion (AutoShiftFix) (iOS 9)  ₁₁₋₂₁₋₁₇
Author: Sinfool
Description: Disables auto shift after deleting characters. Disables auto shift after deleting characters.
 .
 Useful for anyone who is annoyed by stock iOS capitalizing replacement characters when deleting text (i.e. when backspace/deleting two characters in the text "aBc", the new replacement character for "B" is capitalized).
 .
 On iOS 9, this behavior persists even if "Auto-Capitalization" @Settings -> General -> Keyboards is "OFF" however this patch will make new text replacements lowercase.
 .
 [v.1] Tested with an iP6+ on 9.3.3.  Requested by r/jailbreak user /u/clstudios.  (11-21-17)
