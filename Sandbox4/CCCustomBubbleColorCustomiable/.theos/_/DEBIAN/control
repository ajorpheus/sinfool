 IMPORTANT NOTES: This patch uses units also included in the patch titled "CC - Adaptive Dark Mode (Customizable)" so please disable it to use this one.  Also, this includes a very generic method to change the bubble color so therefore it may change the color of other areas of the SpringBoard.  Please leave a comment of such instances.  This hasn't been tested with any other tweaks that tweak the CC UI etc. so you may need to disable them for this patch to work effectively.
 .
 I suggest changing ONLY one unit at a time & respringing after every change you make just to check your results.  If need be, after deleting units you can always delete the patch and re-download it in it's entirety.
