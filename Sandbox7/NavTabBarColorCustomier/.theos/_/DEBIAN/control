Package: com.sinfool.navtabbarcolorcustomier
Name: Nav/Tab Bar - Color Customizer
Author: Sinfool
Description: Changes the color of the nav and tab bars in some apps (doesn't work in all and may change text color elements in others).  By default, I made it a dark color.  Change the color or styles to your liking. Duplicate this patch on a per app basis if you only want it for a specific app. Changes the color of the nav and tab bars in some apps (doesn't work in all and may change text color elements in others).
