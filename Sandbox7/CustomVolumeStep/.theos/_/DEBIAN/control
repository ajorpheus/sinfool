Author: Sinfool
Description: Customizes volume step increments when using the vol rockers.  Values are relative to the current volume level.  You can change the values to your liking.  By default, I have the 'step down' value set to 50% (i.e. if current vol is @100%, then 2 presses will reduce vol to 0%) and the 'step up' value set to 25% (i.e. if current vol is @0%, then 4 presses will increase vol to 100%).
