 [v.1] Tested with an iP6+ 8.4.  (9-8-15)
 .
 ⚠️ WARNING:  This disables all actions used by the rockers (including the ringer vol) therefore all volume adjustments must me made via CC or Settings -> Sounds.  I suggest making a volume menu (with frequently used volume levels i.e. 50%, 75% etc.) via Activator (maybe triggered by a shake or connected to headset etc).
