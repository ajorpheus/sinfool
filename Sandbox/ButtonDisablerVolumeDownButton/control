Author: Sinfool
Description: Disables volume down buttons (on both the device & wired headset). Disables volume down buttons (on both the device & wired headset).

 *Useful if you have broken volume buttons which trigger inadvertently.
 .
 ⚠️ NOTE:  All "volume down" adjustments must me made via control center or "Settings -> Sounds" when using this patch.  I suggest making a volume menu via Activator (with frequently used volume levels i.e. 50%, 75% etc. maybe triggered by a shake or connected to headset etc).
