 KNOWN ISSUES:  Some rotation annoyances & Entry Field/KB will show on Convo list "if" KB is left open & device rotation changes to a new orientation.    
 To avoid these... 
 .
 (1) Try to select conversations while already in your desired orientation 
 (2) Try to collapse the KB before rotating OR just re-select a convo from the main page if the EF/KB does "stick"
