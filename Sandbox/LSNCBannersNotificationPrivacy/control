 .
 Allows you to set a custom message/text (or remove all text) for all notifications thereby giving you the ability to protect your privacy for third party app notifications.  By default, I removed all text except for the preview text which currently displays "New Notification" but you can delete units to show stock text (i.e. the contact/phone # etc) or set a custom text of your choosing.
 .
 Customizes the following text...
 .
 - Primary Text: (Contact/Sender/Phone # etc)
 - Primary Subtitle Text
 - Secondary Text: (Preview/Body/iMessage Text etc)
 - Hint Text: (Slide for more/Unlock for more etc)
 .
 [v.1] Tested with an iPad mini 4 on 10.2.  Made as a request via e-mail.  (10-28-17)
