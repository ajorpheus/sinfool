Name: Status Bar - Custom "IPad" Carrier
Author: Sinfool
Description: Allows you to use custom carrier text on iPads (& I guess other devices without cell service) when cellular data is disabled.  Default iOS shows "iPad" as your user/carrier name when you disable cellular data but this overrides that.  Change the text to your liking.

 .
 IMPORTANT NOTE:  This patch only takes effect after cellular data is enabled so if you have cellular data disabled after a respring, you'll see "Searching..." and then "No Network" until you manually enable/disable cellular data again.
