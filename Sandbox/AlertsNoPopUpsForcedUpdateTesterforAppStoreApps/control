Name: Alerts • No Pop-Ups (Forced Update Tester for AppStore Apps)  ₈₋₂₅₋₁₅
Author: Sinfool
Description: This disables ALL pop-ups system wide which 'some' AppStore apps also use for forced updates (however don't expect it to work for all apps).  You can use this to test if an app's older version still works without updating it.  If it does... than you can re-create this patch for said app or try manually altering the app's info.plist versions etc. This disables ALL pop-ups system wide which 'some' AppStore apps also use for forced updates (however don't expect it to work for all apps).
