Name: Status Bar - Double Height Color (Customizable)
Author: Sinfool
Description: Changes the background and text color of all double height status bars (i.e. the red, green & blue bars when in a call, recording audio or tethering etc.). Also adds an option to make the LS status bar the same height so that the color will apply there as well.  By default, I made the background a dark semi transparent color but you can change the colors to your liking.
