Description: Changes stock Blue & Gray colored Balloons to Green.  By default, I didn't change the Gray Balloon's Black Text color.  Use the "White Text (left balloon)" entry to make it white.  Made as a request via r/flextweak.  Tested with an iP6+ 8.1.  (4-10-15) Changes stock Blue & Gray colored Balloons to Green.  By default, I didn't change the Gray Balloon's Black Text color.
