 IMPORTANT NOTE:  This patch is only useful if you don't actively use folders and are looking for a rudimentary way to...
 .
 * Hide apps from the homescreen (but still have them searchable via SpotLight) or...
 * To create blank icon spaces to use as an alternative to tweaks like Anchor or GridLock.
 .
 DIRECTIONS:
 .
 - CREATING BLANK ICONS:  Make any safari bookmark/web clip & put it into a folder.  Repeat this process for as many blank icons you need.  Position these folders where you want your blank icons.  Enable the patch & respring.
 .
 - HIDING APPS FROM THE HS/SPRINGBOARD:  Put apps in a folder & position it as the last icon on your HS (or wherever you want).  Enable the patch & respring.
 .
 You must disable this patch whenever you'd like to add additional apps/web clips to a folder.
