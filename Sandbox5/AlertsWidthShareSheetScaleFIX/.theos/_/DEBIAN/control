Name: Alerts - Width (Share Sheet Scale FIX)  ₁₀₋₂₁₋₁₅
Author: Sinfool
Description: Changes the width of some alerts (i.e. action & activity/share sheets). Changes the width of some alerts (i.e. action & activity/share sheets).
 .
 NOTE: This "might" also be useful to adjust share sheet scaling to pre iOS 9 sizing.  Only tested on the iP5 but to try this on other devices... find your stock width and set the # just above that threshold, i.e. if it's "320" then try "321" or "322".
 .
 NOTE 2: This patch has been confirmed not working on the iP6 so it may not work for anything other than the iP5.
 .
 [v.1] Tested with an iP5 9.0.2.  (10-21-15)
