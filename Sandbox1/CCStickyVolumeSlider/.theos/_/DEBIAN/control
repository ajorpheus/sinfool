Package: com.sinfool.ccstickyvolumeslider
Name: CC • Sticky Volume Slider  ₉₋₂₂₋₁₅
Author: Sinfool
Description: Forces the CC volume slider to ALWAYS use/adjust to a specified volume by simply tapping the slider dot.  By default, it's currently set to 50% but you can change it to whatever you'd like.  Useful if you normally adjust your volume via the vol rockers and hate having to manually re-adjust/fine tune the CC slider back to your preferred default level.  This can also be used to child proof/lock the system wide volume level by using it along with the SpringBoard patch titled "Disable Volume Rockers".  Made as a request via r/jailbreak.
