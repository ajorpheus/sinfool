Description: Changes stock Green & Gray colored "Send" buttons to Blue.  By default, I didn't change the Gray pre-typing Send button (for standard text messages).  Use the "Gray Pre-Typing Send Button" entry to make it Blue.  Made as a request via r/flextweak.  Tested with an iP6+ 8.1.  (4-10-15) Changes stock Green & Gray colored "Send" buttons to Blue.
